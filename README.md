# CSX_450_2_Final_Iowa

Create A Well-Posed Problem Statement for the Ames Iowa Dataset

Perform simple EDA on the dataset including at least one of each of the following:

 1.  A contingency table

 2.  A distribution plot showing the distribution, mean, and median

 3.  A pair plot for multiple numerical features

 4.  A distribution plot showing the distribution of a numerical feature broken down by a categorical feature

For each of the plots in Step 2, make an analysis of the data that would be understandable to a non-data person

Perform basic preprocessing on your data

  1. Deskew and Scale (use either Standard or Gelman scaling) your Numerical Features

  2. One-hot encode your categorical features

  3. Visualize the transformation of at least three features
  
Use any statistical techniques available to you to identify the 10 most important features

Prepare a principal component analysis of these 10 features. 

  1. Visualize the loadings and prepare an hypothesis about what each of the important principal components means that would be understandable to a non-data person
  
Prepare a cluster model.
